# deep-learning
This repository contains some notebooks that I used to understand Deep Learning concepts such as Neural Networks, Backpropagation, and Transformers. I used Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) library since I followed his YouTube videos while taking a Deep Learning course on my master's degree.
